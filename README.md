workspace_python
========

My personal workspace containing my python code.

This is my own code, it is all a WIP, all the time.
Most of it will be for analysing FVCOM results.
It probably will also be code to analysis ADCP data, create, plot or manipulate finite element files.
No doubt there will be scripts to do other things as well.
